# Blogposts

You will write a short blogpost of approx. 3-4 paragraphs based on your reflections of the assigned materials (readings/videos/podcasts) for that workshop.
Note, this post should not be merely a summary of the readings but your personal reflection of how these relate to your own experience and knowledge, and the content discussed earlier in the course. Your post should make it clear though that you've read and thought about these materials in preparation for the discussion that week.

In addition, each blogpost should 
- list at most one clearly stated question per assigned material/guest.
- ask a question or leave a comment on one other person's post (being professional and polite, naturally)

The blogposts are due by 6pm Monday of that Applications topic.
You may update your posts with additional thoughts and reflections during the week (e.g., how your question was answered explicitly or indirectly).
Please make any changes by the following Monday at 6pm and make sure we can easily identify the changed content.

We will be using Teams as a platform for your blogposts. Channels representing the different topics have already been created. 

### Schedule (2023)
All blog posts due by 6pm Monday the week of the module. I.e., the Applications: Simple Data Mining topic will be discussed in class June 6, so your post is due June 5. 

### Blog Post Quality Criteria

Blog posts are marked pass/fail. You can miss one post; we look at the four highest.

A pass mark is given for meeting all of the following:

- Title is appropriate, added appropriate category
- Introduction (some opening remark)
- Background (based on assigned papers for the week, some mention of each)
- Materials referenced are added as references (at bottom or throughout as links)
- Questions (per assigned reading, that are not already answered by the assigned readings!)
- Conclusion/Takeaway/Some closing remark
- Easy to follow post (cohesive, clear in communicating its ideas)
- On time

Late posts are marked as **fail**.

Some tips:
- If you want to improve your writing skills, do consult the writing department at UVic.  They give excellent advice and will give you feedback on your writing.  For this course that is maybe not urgent, but it will help you in the future!
