# Project Outline

*(Much of this outline taken from Dr Storey's EMSE course)*

The goal of this project is to take a software analytics problem and provide a 10 page report summarizing the approach taken and conclusions drawn. Good examples will be papers published at MSR, ICSE, SANER and similar venues.

For this project, you will need to 
1. Identify a SE problem or question
2. Find a suitable sample and data to solve/answer that problem/question
3. Analyze the data using the techniques covered in class (or others)
4. Write up a report summarizing the problem and solution in academic style, as a Jupyter or Quarto notebook.
5. Present the results as a 5 min slideshow to your colleagues.

## Teams 

The project should ideally be completed in teams of 3-4 students, but students can complete it alone or in pairs if they wish.  The main contribution from this project is about the insights you gained concerning the empirical aspects rather than new knowledge gained through the study. You **MAY NOT** mix graduate students and undergraduate students in your teams.

## Research Ethics

If your project will involve a study with the direct participation of human subjects (e.g., developers or students or other stakeholders participating in a lab experiment, observations, focus group, interviews, surveys), you will need to submit a brief application for ethics approval. We will guide you in this process (you cannot change your mind on this aspect after Nov 16th). Note you cannot use deception or study classmates as part of this study. Further details on how to submit an ethics application can be found [here](https://github.com/margaretstorey/EmseUvic2020/tree/master/activities/project-2-ethics).

## Relation to thesis work or other course work

Please note that this project should be independent from other course projects you have done previously or that you are currently doing, and it should also be independent from research work you have done or are doing for your graduate degree (the reason is that determining what is unique in terms of the contribution for this course becomes problematic). If you are unsure about this aspect, do talk to your instructor about this.  Some overlap in terms of topic or domain is fine, so do check!

## Submissions, due dates, milestones

All of the submissions should take place on Brightspace in the appropriate category. See Brightspace for deadlines. Do NOT wait to get started.

| Milestone                                       | Aim                                    | Value           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [Project Proposal](project-proposal.md)         | Explain idea and get approval          | 10% of project  |
| [Project interim report](project-interim.md)    | Discuss progress to date and timelines | 20% of project  |
| [Project presentation](project-presentation.md) | Show results to colleagues             | 10% of project  |
| [Project final report](project-final.md)        | Write up results and process           | 60%  of project |

## Project Advice

Each student/team member is required to do the following:

1. Follow any updates on this site and meet all of the established interim milestones.
2. Attend all the lectures during the semester, as these will prepare you to succeed in this project.
3. Together with your team mates (if any), choose a topic for your project (details to follow).
4. Contribute equitably throughout the term to the team project in terms of research, video and paper writing.
5. Grade will be determined on a combination of the following:
    - the final report and meeting milestones throughout the term
    - Your grade will also reflect how much you refer to and integrate course concepts throughout the term.
    - Team peer reviews of effort, via Teammates.
    - Extra points may be given for: challenging projects, original ideas, collaboration with external organizations.

### Ways to get bad marks
1. Superficial or lazy replication of existing work. Starting from an existing problem is fine, as are replications, but just re-running analysis someone else did is not enough to pass the project.
2. Letting LLMs do all the analysis work. You can expect me to ask pointed questions about your assumptions, so your team needs to understand what you are doing.
3. Forgetting that this is a short course and explaining you no longer have time to finish the project. 
4. Writing the report at the end, instead of as you go.
5. I'm sure there are others!
