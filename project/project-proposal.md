# Proposals

# Learning Outcomes
- discover different SE data problems
- examine possible SE data sources

# Submission details: 
Submit a PDF report that describes the study you wish to design with the following information:
* Team members
* Motivation
* Research goal or question
* Expected Data Sources
* Research Strategies
* Potential Limitations
* Expected Results
* Core References
   
The proposal should be considered as a working document. You will likely update it after I have a chance to read what you plan and we can discuss your next steps. 

# Proposal Tips
It is tempting to treat the proposal as a gimme and not put effort into it. And yet in MY view, it is the most critical part of the project. **Spend some serious time on it.** (like 5-10 hours I would say).

Your proposal should answer the following questions:
1. What is the software problem you are focused on?  Even for a new study, you should have a clear sense of other approaches to this problem. Your life will be easier if you have a clear guide. Don't worry if it feels like "cheating" because the original paper was so clear and the data so accessible. We can easily add complexity; it is very hard to take it away. 
2. The dataset you are using, and the experiments you have done with it. Don't just trust that the paper URL is still there, or that the data is accessible or useful. Download it, load it into R/Jupyter, and do some simple experiments. 
3. Any other tools you will need, how well you know them, and what they cost. For example, you might require a .NET component that the original study used, but you do not have a Windows machine. Or you will use a DL approach that requires Google TPUs to train. 
4. The research questions you are trying to answer. What is the contribution your paper will make?  I suggest using the answers to #1 above, checking what those papers say was either hard, interesting new directions, or questions they didn't have time to answer. You might also find gaps in the original analysis.
5. Rough sense of methodology you will follow and *who* will be doing each task. At the very least there will be writing of the paper, creating the video, running the analysis, processing/preparing the data, writing analysis code, reading relevant background papers, ... start outlining that. SHow some table or Gantt chart thing to codify this with your team. Marks will be lost for superficial reports; you need to have a firm idea of how long each task will take. I like [MarkWhen for timelines](https://meridiem.markwhen.com).
6. Relative to the methodology, specify exactly what the workflow is: data sources, filtering criteria, data science algorithms to use, analysis validation etc. Don't underestimate how long it takes to acquire data and write analysis code. 

**I reserve the right to change your project or increase/decrease its scope as necessary**. Once you have had the proposal returned, you should consider that ** an agreement between us** on the amount of work expected to receive a good mark. If you leave it to the last minute, don't expect to lower the scope in response to running short on time. 


# Potential Project Ideas

For some ideas of projects you can replicate that are based on data traces only, you may get some ideas from this book: http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/ (see also http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/ESEUR-draft.pdf and
https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-code-data for the code and data).

Or you may wish to replicate a study from an existing paper that has replication materials available. GHTorrent is another possibility but pay attention to the Perils paper we read by Kalliamvakou et al.!

The MSR challenges may provide some ideas, e.g. see [2020 MSR challenge papers](https://2020.msrconf.org/track/msr-2020-mining-challenge?track=MSR%20Mining%20Challenge#Resources-for-Participants), see other MSR challenge years. This page also lists some datasets: https://github.com/woc-hack/msr-hackathon/blob/master/README.md

There are also several papers and blog posts that identify "the questions developers want answers to:
- Greg Wilson, [Software engineering research ideas](https://third-bit.com/2022/08/30/research-topics/)
- Microsoft Research, "[Analyze This!: 145 Questions for Data Scientists in Software Engineering"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/analyze-this-145-questions-for-data-scientists-in-software-engineering/)

# Potential Data Sources

- [Software Heritage graph](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-dataset/graph/)
- GHTorrent
- TravisTorrent
- [GrimoireLab](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab/)
* Various datasets from the MSR Data Challenges (see above)
* APIs, such as the Github API

# Marking Criteria
- All required information provided in sufficient detail
- The report is clear, well formatted, and professional
- Evidence of thought about project idea and data sources

# Late Submissions
No late submissions. 
If you have a legitimate reason for submitting late, discuss this with the lecturer well in advance of the assignment due date.
