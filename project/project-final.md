  * Introduction
  * Motivation for this research, to whom is it relevant and why, context of your study
  * Related work (this may come later in your paper if you do some kind of a grounded theory!)
  * Brief literature review on this topic (can't be complete but should include the main key references!)
  * Research questions and methodology (choice of methodology, clear framing of questions is important)
  * Results or Findings 
  * Discussion (what did you learn, what can you speculate but can't prove that could be future work, what does this relate to in terms of other work)
  * Limitations (consider limitations of method choice, statistical approach, but also of the methods you used)
  * Conclusion/Future work (consider relevance of the work)
  * References (use the proper ACM format! )
  * Appendix A: describe and provide links to any supplementary materials or replication package.
  * Appendix B: if this was done as a team, please include a description of how the team members contributed to the project. 
 
Grades may not be evenly distributed in the case some team members did considerably more than others.
