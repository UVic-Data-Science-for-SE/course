# Project Outline

*(Much of this outline taken from Dr Storey's EMSE course)*

The goal of this project is to take a software analytics question and provide a 10 page report summarizing the approach taken and conclusions drawn. Good examples will be papers published at MSR, ICPC, SANER and similar venues.

For this project, you will conduct a replication of an existing study published in a software engineering research venue, or you may wish to design a novel study.  The replication is likely to be a conceptual replication where you retest the same theoretical ideas or hypotheses, but with a different population, or different study design, different ways of manipulating or measuring variables.
A literal replication may also be acceptable, especially if you carefully follow the same steps and provide some kind of reflection and critique of the study (with perhaps suggestions of what you would do differently next time or if it worked well, how you might broaden the study in future).

## Teams 

The project should ideally be completed in teams of 3-4 students, but students can complete it alone or in pairs if they wish.  The main contribution from this project is about the insights you gained concerning the empirical aspects rather than new knowledge gained through the study. You **MAY NOT** mix graduate students and undergraduate students in your teams.

## Research Ethics

If your project will involve a study with the direct participation of human subjects (e.g., developers or students or other stakeholders participating in a lab experiment, observations, focus group, interviews, surveys), you will need to submit a brief application for ethics approval. We will guide you in this process (you cannot change your mind on this aspect after Nov 16th). Note you cannot use deception or study classmates as part of this study. Further details on how to submit an ethics application can be found [here](https://github.com/margaretstorey/EmseUvic2020/tree/master/activities/project-2-ethics).

## Relation to thesis work or other course work

Please note that this project should be independent from other course projects you have done previously or that you are currently doing, and it should also be independent from research work you have done or are doing for your graduate degree (the reason is that determining what is unique in terms of the contribution for this course becomes problematic). If you are unsure about this aspect, do talk to your instructor about this.  Some overlap in terms of topic or domain is fine, so do check!

## Submissions, due dates, milestones

All of the submissions should take place on Brightspace in the appropriate category. See Brightspace for deadlines. Do NOT wait to get started.

	| Project Proposal    |  10% of project | |
	| Project interim report | 20% of project |  |
	| Project presentation | 10% of project | | 
	| Project final report | 60%  of project |  | 

## Project Advice

Each student/team member is required to do the following:

1. Follow any updates on this site and meet all of the established interim milestones.
2. Attend all the lectures during the semester, as these will prepare you to succeed in this project.
3. Together with your team mates (if any), choose a topic for your project (details to follow).
4. Contribute equitably throughout the term to the team project in terms of research, video and paper writing.
5. Grade will be determined on a combination of the following:
    - 20% of your grade for this project component will be given for presentation in class (prepared video or tiktok!)
    - 80% of your grade will be based on the final report and meeting milestones throughout the term
    - Your grade will also reflect how much you refer to and integrate course concepts throughout the term
    - Extra points may be given for: challenging projects, original ideas, collaboration with external organizations.

# Potential Data Sources

For some ideas of projects you can replicate that are based on data traces only, you may get some ideas from this book: http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/ (see also http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/ESEUR-draft.pdf and
https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-code-data for the code and data).
Or you may wish to replicate a study from an existing paper that has replication materials available. GHTorrent is another possibility but pay attention to the Perils paper we read by Kalliamvakou et al.!
The MSR challenges may provide some ideas, e.g. see [2020 MSR challenge papers](https://2020.msrconf.org/track/msr-2020-mining-challenge?track=MSR%20Mining%20Challenge#Resources-for-Participants), see other MSR challenge years. This page also lists some datasets: https://github.com/woc-hack/msr-hackathon/blob/master/README.md
Also smaller workshops (e.g., CHASE) at ICSE may have studies that are of smaller scope that do not rely on data mining. You may take one of these designs, critique it, redesign and if possible run a pilot with a new design.
