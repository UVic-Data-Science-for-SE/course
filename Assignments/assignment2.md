In this assignment, you will watch Netflix, specifically near-future speculative fiction like Black Mirror, and generate script ideas for new episodes. You will also analyze a ML4SE paper for ethical impacts of the technology using "41 Questions".

# Part 1. Black Mirror Writer's Room exercise
(shoutout to [Casey Fiesler](https://caseyfiesler.com/about/) for the original idea and just being kinda awesome). 

A Writer's Room is the name for where creative writing happens on TV shows. One genre of shows explores **near-future** (i.e., not too different from today) issues. Examples include the [Black Mirror series](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/70264888) (Netflix), [Gattaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca), [Minority Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)), and others. Star Trek would be an example of far-future issues (as we are unlikely to get replicators anytime soon :().

Read the show synopsis carefully - this is what you will be writing. A synopsis is essentially the "abstract" for the show. It is what a writer might pitch to a streaming service if they wanted funding to make the show.

In this exercise, you are asked to watch one of these shows or read a short story like Corey Doctorow's [Car Wars](https://doctorow.medium.com/car-wars-a01718a27e9e).

You will become the writer. Write a short, 1-2 page paper (approximately 500 words) that you could pitch as the summary of a Netflix episode or short story. The paper should include the synopsis based on the thinking below, a title, and some current technology you based it on (e.g., Copilot). We will listen to some sample pitches in class.

1. Brainstorm near future technology based on a topic from the course, i.e., software analytics, data science, AI-driven code completion, etc.. It should be close enough that it seems like a plausible future, i.e., no replicators, warp drive, death stars.
2. What are the potential social implications and/or ethical issues and/or regulatory challenges with this technology?
3. ​What do you think might be a cautionary tale related to this technology? Be creative and feel free to make up stories about hypothetical future people.​
4. What fictional person in the future could best illustrate this caution?​
5. What is their story?

Do not use GenAI beyond basic proof-reading. 
## Sample Topics

* Machine learning on code
* Copyright issues with code
* Algorithmic decision making
* Software and safety or software and security
* Applying software data mining to examine productivity of engineers
* Using AI to write code, like ["Son-of-Anton" from Silicon Valley](https://youtu.be/ySDX02WD0og?t=102) "the most efficient way to get rid of all the bugs is to get rid of all the software". 

# Part 2 - 41 Questions

Pick one of the papers in the assigned or optional readings we have looked at (or will look at). Then analyze that paper using the [41 Questions Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gypuJ0cJZ0PdDcZRNddlCKSrznCm8DPbAdw9N46grWY/edit), based on [this essay](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/the-questions-concerning-technology). Answer at least 10 of the 41 questions in a PDF document using the last digit of your V#. Please number the questions carefully so I can figure out what you are answering.

Ensure that you have clearly identified the paper, and give a brief (100-200 word) synopsis of the paper's ideas.

# Hand In

* the 1-2 page pitch as txt or PDF, which includes the story, the current tech it is based on, and the dark and light futures it may produce (a "light" future is one where humanity benefits from this tech).
* the 10 questions as the same PDF file.
