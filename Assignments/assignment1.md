In this assignment, you will be using R to run some simple data science approaches on an SE dataset. 

# Preparation
You should install R, RStudio, or similar tool (there are good plugins for VSCode).  

You should follow this [set up and tutorial on R.](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/Regression_and_Other_Stories_Appendix_A.pdf).

We will be using RStudio/R for this and assignment 2. Follow [this overview](docker.md) to get started.

# Dataset and Problem

This assignment will work on the following problem set. Download it and use it in your notebook. Submit the notebook as a Rmd file for marking, via Brightspace. You should answer all the questions (below, in bold) in the notebook directly, supported by the R code as necessary.

## Data Exploration

Produce a scatter plot and a histogram that shows what the data look like. 
Q1. What interesting insights do you see? 

## Model Specification
Create a linear regression model to test the insight you had formed. 
Q2. WHat is the model format?

## Model Estimation
Run the linear regression using stan_glm.

## Model Evaluation
Check how well this model performs on the other data that you held back.

## Model Interpretation
Write 500 words summarizing the model you created and the insights it produced. Be sure to comment on the improtant principles we examined:
- data provenance
- measure validity
- measure reliability
