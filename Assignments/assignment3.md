In this assignment, you will watch Netflix, specifically near-future speculative fiction like Black Mirror, and generate script ideas for new episodes. You will also analyze a ML4SE paper for ethical impacts of the technology using "41 Questions".

# Part 1. Black Mirror Writer's Room exercise

A Writer's Room is the name for where creative writing happens on TV shows. One genre of shows explores near-future (i.e., not too different from today) issues. Examples include the Black Mirror series (Netflix), Gattaca, Minority Report, and others. Star Trek would be an example of far-future issues (as we are unlikely to get replicators anytime soon).

In this exercise, you are asked to watch one of these shows (or read a short story like Corey Doctorow's car wars).

Read the show synopsis carefully - this is what you will be writing.

Then you will become the writer. Write a short, 1-2 page paper (approximately 500 words) that you could pitch as the summary of a Netflix episode or short story. The paper should include the synopsis based on the thinking below, a title, and some current technology you based it on (e.g., Copilot). We will listen to some sample pitches in class.

1. Brainstorm near future technology based on a topic from the course, i.e., software analytics, data science, AI-driven code completion, etc.. It should be close enough that it seems like a plausible future, i.e., no replicators, warp drive, death stars.
2. What are the potential social implications and/or ethical issues and/or regulatory challenges with this technology?
​3. What do you think might be a cautionary tale related to this technology? Be creative and feel free to make up stories about hypothetical future people.​
4. What fictional person in the future could best illustrate this caution?​
5. What is their story?

## Sample Topics

* Machine learning on code
* Copyright issues with code
* Algorithmic decision making
* Software and safety or software and security

# Part 2 - 41 Questions

Pick one of the papers in the assigned or optional readings we have looked at (or will look at). Then analyze that paper using the 41 Questions Template, based on this essay. Answer at least 10 of the 41 questions in a (new or same) PDF document using the last digit of your V#. Please number the questions carefully so I can figure out what you are answering.

Ensure that you have clearly identified the paper, and give a brief (100-200 word) synopsis of the paper's ideas.

# Hand In

* the 1 page pitch as txt or PDF, which includes the story, the current tech it is based on, and the dark and light futures it may produce (a "light" future is one where humanity benefits from this tech).
* the 10 questions as the same or different PDF.
