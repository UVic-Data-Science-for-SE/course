# Overview

You should know how to use Github, be familiar with statistical concepts from second year, and be able to write basic Python code and tests.

**All due dates will be on Brightspace. All submissions should be on Brightspace in the appropriate assignment folder.** 

Assignments are due on Friday by midnight. You may take 2 days more to update your assignment (i.e., Sunday night) once you have submitted. You **must** submit something by Friday. I will not answer assignment questions after Friday, however.

The details of the assignments are as follows:
