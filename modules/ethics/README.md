title: Ethical SE Data Science
---

Data mining, data science, and machine learning open up problematic (and interesting) research questions and obligations. We will go over some of the basic problems, some approaches to resolve those, and discuss current issues.

# Learning Outcomes

- address concept of ethical problems in SE-oriented data science.
- identify choices that are more ethical rather than less.
- frame ethical dilemmas using existing frameworks.
