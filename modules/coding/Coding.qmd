## Coding Practice {.exercise}

We have data on change rationale from people who edited StackOverflow (SO) questions. Questions can be edited by moderators or the original asker.

We want to know "Why do people edit a SO question?"? 

1. I've added 14 CSV files to the teams channel. 
2. Pick one of the files to work on, corresponding to your Brightspace group ID. 

## {.exercise}
3. Read each row entry, using
   1. your prior understanding of SO, 
   2. the link to the question in the CSV, and 
   3. the text itself
4. assign a short label to each of the ten entries by yourself.
5. Then check your labels with the ones your group added. 
6. Now run the 10 entries through the GenAI tool of your choice.
   
## Reflection

::: {.incremental}
- did you and your colleagues agree? Where and why? 
- what value did the LLM add? 
- what is your assessment of why people edit these questions?
