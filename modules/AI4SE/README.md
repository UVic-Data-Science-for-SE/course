How to use AI to do software engineering (mid 2025 version!)

# Learning Outcomes

- be able to explain components of the AI4SE lifecycle:
	- prompting
	- context and RAG
	- evals
	- models and pitfalls
- use a modern LLM for software development
- contextualize the places AI can assist in, replace, and/or hinder good SE practices and good SE systems.

# Topics and slides
These are the submodules I covered in class. 

*  [AI4SE](aiforSE_pub.qmd)

### Readings (before class)
1.  [Simon Willison: How I use LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/)
3.  [Fowler: Exploring GenAI series](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai.html); 
4.  [Gene Kim/Steve Yegge pairing with Claude Code (watch)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtqxI53h7zM)

In the previous class we installed a common set of AI tools. Make sure that this works for you on a machine you can bring to class. 

### Exercises

These are done in class. The source code below is a combo of what I typed and what I prepped before hand. 

1.  Vibe Coding example
2.  Using Claude Code

### Optional Readings and Activities
3.  [Fowler: Patterns for GenAI series](https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/)
