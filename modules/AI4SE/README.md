How to use AI to do software engineering (mid 2025 version!)

# Learning Outcomes

- be able to explain components of the AI4SE lifecycle:
	- prompting
	- context and RAG
	- tool use with MCP
	- evals
	- models and pitfalls
- use a modern LLM for software development
- contextualize the places AI can assist in, replace, and/or hinder good SE practices and good SE systems.

# Topics and slides
These are the submodules I covered in class. 

*  [AI4SE](aiforSE_pub.qmd)

### Readings (before class)
1.  [Simon Willison: How I use LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/)
2.  [Simon Willison: The Last 6 Months in LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/6/six-months-in-llms/)
3.  [Fowler: Exploring GenAI series](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai.html); 
4.  [Gene Kim/Steve Yegge pairing with Claude Code (watch)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtqxI53h7zM)

In the previous class we installed a common set of AI tools. Make sure that this works for you on a machine you can bring to class. 

### Exercises

These are done in class. The source code below is a combo of what I typed and what I prepped before hand. 

1.  Vibe Coding example
2.  Using Claude Code

### Optional Readings and Activities
3. [Fowler: Patterns for GenAI series](https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/)	
1. [Kalliamvakou: quantifying GitHub Copilotâ€™s impact on developer productivity and happiness](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/)
2. [Lewis et al., Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401)
3. [Willison, LLM tutorial](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/15/building-on-llms/) - I drew on this a lot for my notes.

#### Other things I've come across
1. https://bramcohen.com/p/vibe-coding - helfpul prompt suggestions to fix Claude mistakes
2. https://annievella.com/posts/the-software-engineering-identity-crisis/ - on the transition from craft to oversight in SE
3. https://fortune.com/2025/05/18/ai-chatbots-study-impact-earnings-hours-worked-any-occupation/ - maybe AI isn't as great as it is made out to be?
4. https://www.anildash.com//2025/05/20/mcp-web20-20/ Guy who has been around protocols for a while talks MCP.
