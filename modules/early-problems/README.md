title: Early Approaches and Problems in SE data

---

Early work in DS for SE, and some possible challenges. 

# Learning Outcomes

- How the field started; lessons from the past. Taylorism. Is SE "engineering" or factory work? Contrarianism.
- Challenges with SE data mining and data sources.
- Understand limitations with SE inferences

These are done in class. The source code below is a combo of what I typed and what I prepped before hand. 

1. Sampling exercise
2. Data validity exercise
3. Explore a repo using CodeScene metrics
