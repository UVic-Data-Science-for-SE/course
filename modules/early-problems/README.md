title: Early Approaches and Problems in SE data

---

Early work in DS for SE, and some possible challenges. 

# Learning Outcomes

- Appreciate how the field started; lessons from the past. Taylorism. 
- Differentiate between SE "engineering" and factory work?
- Challenges with SE data mining and data sources.
- Understand limitations with SE inferences

These are done in class. The source code below is a combo of what I typed and what I prepped before hand. 

3. Explore a repo using SonarQube metrics - linked in the notes
4. [Write R code to load and explore simple data](../../src/problems/null_hypothesis_testing.qmd)
5. [Power calculations app](https://btkbef-neil0ernst.shinyapps.io/power-app/)
6. Sampling exercise (in class)
7. Data validity exercise
