title: Topic Modeling in SE
---

Lots of software engineering involves processing unstructured text, e.g., from issue discussions, documentation sites, app reviews. Topic modeling is a technique for capturing the latent (hidden) topics of a document that has been widely applied in SE.

# Learning Outcomes
- overview knowledge of the way statistical topic models work.
- analyze a topic model and understand its benefits and drawbacks.
