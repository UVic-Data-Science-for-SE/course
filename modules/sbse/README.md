title: Search-based SE and SE/Non-SE data
---

Search-based software engineering is a combination of optimization approaches to heuristically search for solutions to common SE problems like test optimization.
Our second unit will be the way in which SE data differs from non-SE data.

# Learning Outcomes
- introductory understanding of how heuristics can improve SE problem solutions
- awareness of domain-specific nature of SE machine learning needs
