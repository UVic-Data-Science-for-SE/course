## Discussion

We discussed the need for out of sample training data. This is known as the principle of Generalizability. 

## Exercise {.exercise}
1. Two tools for building web apps are Vue.js and React. These both basically do the same thing, and are written in the same languages (JS/TS). 
2. Go to [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and to [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/core)
3. Find a PR in both repos that deals with something similar. For example, you might want to look at security issues or UI issues. 

## Exercise cont {.exercise}

One example: https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/13550 and https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30451 both deal with whitespace issues.

4. Pretend you and your group are building a Data Science tool to help with PR assignment. What elements of each project will make it:
   1. Harder to generalize your results?
   2. Easier to generalize your results?  
5. Report back.
