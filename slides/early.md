# Early Days

"Computers" → women doing slide rule calculations as shown in Hidden Figures. 

Proprietary data from big projects: the A7 software project, IBM's OS/360 project. An era of positivism and Taylorism: if only we can measure what people are doing, we can manage it like we would building pyramids.

This was ultimately shown to be false in two seminal analyses: Brooks's mythical man-month project and Peopleware. It paralleled similar revolutions in sociology, epistemology, critical theory that pointed out the many flaws in a strictly empirical approach to culture, science, literature, the "counter culture" if you will. But people like Brooks are hardly hippies; what he saw was - I think - deeply distressing for him, someone raised on math and engineering. 

# The Open Source Era

# Bringing Insights into Practice: The Sapienz Example

From the SCAM Facebook paper:

1. Irrelevant: ‘Academics need to make their research more industrially-relevant’, 
2. Unconvincing: ‘Scientific work should be evaluated on large-scale real-world problems’, 
3. Misdirected: ‘Researchers need to spend more time understanding the problems faced by the industry’, 
4. Unsupportive: ‘Industry needs to provide more funding for research’, 
5. Closed System: ‘Industrialists need to make engineering production code and software engineering artifacts available for academic study’, and 
6. Closed Mind: ‘Industrialists are unwilling to adopt promising research’.

## Insights into the human aspect

> Developers are, in practice, not short of lists of fault and failure reports from which they might choose to act

Thus the tool - the data science output---must ensure it produces work that has:

* **Relevance**: the developer to whom the bug report is sent is one of the set of suitable people to fix the bug; 
* **Context**: the bug can be understood efficiently; 
* **Timeliness**: the information arrives in time to allow an effective bug fix. 
* **Debug payload**: the information provided by the tool makes the fix process efficient;
