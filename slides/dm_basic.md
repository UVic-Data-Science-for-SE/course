# Basics of Data Mining in SE

# What is SE Data

*Exercise: TPS on types of data*

- Naturalness
- Promises and Perils of {Git|Github}
- Threats to aggregating repos
- Data science smells

# Data Exploration

* Visualization MPL and GGplot 
* Descriptive stats  - mean, median, variance 
* Probability distributions and fit (seaborn)

# Regression

(Find things)

OLS in Python - Geron p 106  Grus p 185

SGD alg Grus p 187

Regularization (Grus p 200)

# Clustering

(Group things) 

K-means in Python (Grus P 170)

# Optimization

The simplest approach: GATE

**G** enerate  from data, priors, fuzzing

**A** ssess how well that approach works, quickly 

**T** ry (**e**valuate, maybe slow e.g. ask a human)
