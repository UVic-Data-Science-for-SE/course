# Overview

You should know how to use GitHub, be familiar with statistical concepts from second year, and be able to write basic R or Python code and tests.

**All due dates are on Brightspace. All work should be on GitHub with a final submission on Brightspace in the appropriate assignment folder. The details of the assignments are contained in Brightspace.** 

If you cannot see the Assignment on Brightspace, it is a group assignment, and you need to be in a group to view it. Join a group as I discussed in class first.

Assignments are due on Friday by midnight. You may take 2 days more to update your assignment (i.e., Sunday night) once you have submitted. You **must** submit something by Friday. I will not answer assignment questions after Friday, however.

- Assignment 1: Getting Started with R and Data Science
- Assignment 2: Ethical Data Science
- Assignment 3: Bayesian Inference
- Grad Assignment: Paper Discussions
