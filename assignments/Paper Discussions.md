title: Paper Discussions
author: Neil Ernst 
---

Each grad student will be responsible for presenting a summary of one of the papers we are assigned in class. You will work in teams of 2. 

You will read the paper, and then create a presentation (Keynote, Powerpoint, Quarto, PDF all work). The presentation will be around 20 minutes.

It should contain:
- short summary of the main ideas in the paper. We've all read it, so this needn't be more than 3-4 minutes. Reproducing the key graphs and tables is important, though, as the discussion will likely refer to these.
- discussion points you found interesting/controversial/incorrect/... about the paper. Below I list some suggestions from a conference, REFSQ, that has this model. Make sure you correctly identify the paper type.
- one of the discussion points should be an assessment of the **ethical implications** of the work. You should use the [NeurIps "broader impacts" checklist](https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist) (see Q. 10)
- another one should be **open science and reproducibility**: can others redo this work easily? 

You will then lead the class through a discussion of the main points your slides raised. 

# Marking Criteria
You are marked on your slide presentation quality (25%), your insights into the paper (50%), and your moderation of the discussion (25%). You and your partner, if any, share the marks equally.

## Presentation Quality
- slides are legible from anywhere in the room
- slides are coherent and follow a logical pattern
- text per slide is appropriate and not distracting
- No marks for just rehashing what the paper says; AI can also do this. 

## Moderation Skills
- discussion is on topic
- moderators handle interruptions and disruptions, if any
- everyone gets to participate if wanted
- moderators did not attempt to influence direction of on topic discussions
- moderators prepared for lulls and pauses in the discussion

## Paper Insights
- questions raised demonstrate insight into the paper
- summary shows presenters have actually read the paper
- presenters thoroughly understand the paper and its key points
  - including ethical impacts and open science aspects

# Sign Up 

Note: the paper needs to be a full length (10+ pages) conference or journal article.
